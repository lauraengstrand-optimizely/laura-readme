__Favorite quote:__ Be nice to people; because what's stopping them from plucking one of your hairs and placing it at a crime scene? Nothing.... 

* I am an introvert. Do not confuse my quiet with lack of engagement. 
* I have been told I can be direct, my intent is to be honest.
* I am a classically trained dancer, an aspiring pianist, an avid pluviophile and a former child. 
* I am quite the accomplished home cook ( especially baking ).  
* Because I love to eat, I spend a lot of time working out in one form or another. 
* I share a birthday with J.R.R Tolkien, Victor Borge and Maxene Andrews. 
* I have lived in 3 time zones and visited 5 additional time zones ( 13 countries ). 
* When the laws change, I will marry my cat - [Miche LaVaughn](https://www.instagram.com/miche.lavaughn/). 
* Chocolate is my drug of choice.

## Meetings 
We will have a 1:1 every week for 30 minutes no matter what ( unless one of us is on PTO ). These meetings are for you, come prepared. The intent of this meeting is to discuss topics of substance ( including what you did over the weekend ), not updates. If the meeting is over prior to 30 minutes there is no need to awkwardly fill the time or sit in silence. 

Feel free to put a meeting on my calendar, do not feel like you need to ask first. 

## Communication 
- You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I respond pretty quickly between 0800 and 2300. 
- I work a bit in the evenings and on the weekends. This is my choice. I might Slack or email you, but unless the message says URGENT, it can always wait until the next working day. 
- When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. 
- Heard a rumour? Need clarification on something? Blocked? I’d love to hear as soon as possible. Come by my desk, stop me in the hall, shoot me a Slack message, we don’t need to wait for our next scheduled 1:1. Feel free to put something in my calendar; do not feel like you need to ask first. 
- We will disagree on something at some point in time. That is OK. 
- Sometimes I ask a question like , “When do you expect to finish X?” This doesn’t mean “Hurry up and finish X.”. I might just be curious, need to know for a planning exercise, or be making sure you get the time you need and aren’t expected to start something else in the meantime. 
- I may have information that I am not allowed to share with you but I will never lie to you.
- I need your feedback to improve in my role. Tell me. Hold me accountable.
- If you have an issue or a concern, tell me. I may not be able to fix it but if you don't inform me, it definitely won't improve.
- Anytime you do not feel comfortable talking to me about something, please go over my head ( or to a peer manager ). I will not be offended. 

## My role 
- I will not try to do your job ( well, I might try ). If I am questioning you it could be I am trying to gather context for my own edification OR I am trying to help you vet your ideas OR  I am trying to help you think outside the box
- You can always [rubber duck debug](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) with me ( even if I don't always understand ) 
- Hire and retain top talent ( like you ).
- Set clear context so you can be successful.
- I will give you feedback in a timely matter. 
- I will be as transparent and visible as possible.
- I am not your parent; I expect you to act like an adult.
- I work for you ( but obviously have a responsibility to my manager and the company ).  I have your back. 

## My goal 
- Individually, and as a  team, you are highly functional. 
- You feel empowered to figure out what you need to do and how you think it should be done and then to get it done. You have enough context to understand your priorities for a given period of time.
- You have built effective relationships with others in the company.
- We have a clear roadmap. 

## My expectation of you 
- Write quality code AND unit tests. Own your code. 
- Ask questions – be curious.
- Be prepared to explain decisions you have made, both to peer engineers and to me 
- Prioritize ( you own your own time, if you need help ask questions ) 
- Be willing to reflect on any mistakes; we will sometimes have learning reviews ( aka, post-mortem, retrospective ) which are NOT about blame. 
- Make sure you get everything you need ( requirements, design, QA, statisticians ) to execute all the way to production. Keep your JIRA tickets up to date ( status, comments and such )
- Show Grit – be willing to stick with a hard path
- You should be learning as you go 

### Don't withhold feedback for me
If you have feedback for me, please give it. Constructive feedback gives me insight into how I can improve.  Getting your feedback in a timely manner is also quite important. If something isn't going well, I prefer to make a change quickly rather than to have the problem festerIf you are not comfortable giving me this feedback in person, I encourage you to speak with someone above me in the management chain. 

## Your development 
Your career is your responsibility. I am here to help you achieve your professional goals.  Ask for what you want and we can work together.   

## Work-life balance 
It is important to find a healthy balance between work and the rest of your life. 
My goal is to be in the office by 9AM but if history is any guide , closer to 9:30.  I meander out by 5:30 most days. 
I might Slack or email you things off hours, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until the next working day.

As for your schedule: do what works for you. Try to maintain a somewhat consistent schedule from day to day.
